### C. `mavenhive-website` – README

```markdown
# MavenHive Website

This repository hosts the public website for **MavenHive**, my startup focused on
AI–driven automation and analytics products.

Beyond the company site itself, I keep this repository public so that other developers
can study and reuse the **frontend architecture and deployment patterns**.

## What this project showcases

- Modern component-based web stack (e.g. React / modern JS bundler)
- Routing, layout and responsive design for a marketing site
- Simple content structure for product pages and blog-style updates
- Basic CI / deployment workflow suitable for small startups

## Why it is public

- To act as a **reference implementation** for mentees building their first product sites.
- To show how to keep a codebase clean and modular even for “simple” marketing pages.
- To give the community a concrete example of **shipping a real product website** end-to-end.

## Running locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunamis2015/mavenhive-website.git

npm install
npm run dev    # or npm start, depending on framework
